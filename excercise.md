##Exercise: ft_print_variables_length
Allowed functions : printf

Create a program that prints the length of two user input variables. 
The first input is an integer and the second input is a string (character array).
First, the user should be asked to enter an integer and a string, each separated by newline. 
Then, the program prints the length of the integer and the string as:
Length of integer: -number-
Length of string: -number-

Note:
- The integer length is the number of digits.
- The string length is the number of characters in the string (excluding the null character at the end).

Here's how your function should be prototyped : 
`void ft_print_variables_length();`
